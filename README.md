# Centum

Centum is a Python package facilitating water accounting through energy and water balance modeling. It provides tools for analyzing and modeling water use efficiency, illegal pumping detection, and the protection of mountain ecosystems.

Centum rely on EB and SWB models:
- Energy balance modeling outputs (ETa) from pyTSEB
- Water balance modeling outputs (ETa) from pyCATHY

## Features expected
- Water delineation using ratio of ET
- Water net quantification using ET baseline - ET Earth Observation

## Features expected
- Methods for detecting illegal water pumping.
- Support for ecosystem drought resilience assessments by quantification of green water footprint.

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install centum
